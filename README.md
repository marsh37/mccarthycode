## Language Philosophy

McCarthyScript embraces the sparse, direct style of Cormac McCarthy's writing. The language is designed to be:
- Minimalist
- Direct
- Unambiguous
- Focused on essential operations

Each command should feel like a clear, declarative statement, much like McCarthy's prose.
